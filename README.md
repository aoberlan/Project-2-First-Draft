# Project-2-First-Draft
This was the first draft for Project 2

Two files are needed to run this code:

1) Project 2 Jupyter Notebok
2) The fasta file used in Project 2
Both are uploaded here

Information about where the fasta file was found: The genetic sequence for the histone H2AX in Carcharodon carcharias (great white shark) was obtained from searching the NCBI "Gene" database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/121274871). This information was downloaded as a .fasta file (where the gene is located on chromosome 39), which then had a BLAST analysis performed on the sequence to look for similar genomic sequences in other organisms using NCBI and an xml file was the output. The xml was turned into a csv for further analysis (along with another csv with the 577 histones listed for the great white shark (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=Carcharodon+carcharias+histone)), and this data was manipulated for further methods and analysis.

Scientific Question: Does the maintenance of genomic stability in great white sharks occur mainly due to their large number of histone genes (compared to other species and because of their much larger genome requiring efficient DNA packaging), or from the positive selection and accumulation of specific histone genes involved in acetylation and methylation?

Scientific Hypothesis: If certain large vertebrates like great white sharks have been able to show greater genomic stability through the function of certain positively selected genes (i.e., large histone gene family expansion) compared to other species, then a major molecular adaptive emphasis is having an effective expansion of genes responsible for genomic stability and the DNA damage response.
