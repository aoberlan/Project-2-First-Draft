    "## Scientific Question: Does the maintenance of genomic stability in great white sharks occur mainly due to their large number of histone genes (compared to other species and because of their much larger genome requiring efficient DNA packaging), or from the positive selection and accumulation of specific histone genes involved in acetylation and methylation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Histones are proteins that provide structural support for chromosomes (as the DNA is wound tightly around the hsitones to create nucleosomes). Another important function for histone modifications is  DNA damage response, where due to their large genome and the associated requirements for packing DNA efficiently, great white sharks have a high number of core histone proteins present in the genome (notably with a large amount of H2A histone genes). Phosphorylation of H2AX is associated with the recruitment of DNA repair proteins, working to ensure genomic stability along with other notable histones with other functions, such as H3K56. Histone variants play a role in the DNA damage signaling and repair pathway choice, especially the H2A histone variants which are abundant in sharks. When there is less acetylation of histones then the created DNA is more likely to be damaged, with the DNA damage repair then wanting to work to preserve acetylation. However, less histone acetylation occurrs when there is less DNA damage, so acetylation is often retained at histone sites near DNA damage in places it is normally de-acetylated (when no damage is detected by the DNA damage checkpoint proteins).\n",

The use of NCBI data files allows for researchers at a non-commercial level to develop and test new information technologies that have the ability to aid in the understanding of fundamental molecular and genetic processes, which can affect human health and treatment of disease."

    "## Scientific Hypothesis: If certain large vertebrates like great white sharks have been able to show greater genomic stability through the function of certain positively selected genes (i.e., large histone gene family expansion) compared to other species, then a major molecular adaptive emphasis is having an effective expansion of genes responsible for genomic stability and the DNA damage response.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pandas: Pandas is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool used in Python that is used by many in the field of data science and analysis, as well as bioinformatics and even with machine learning. It is built upon Numpy and is commonly used in many if not all of the most popular data analysis tools and packages, and it can support a variety of tasks (not limited to data cleansing, filling, normalization, inspection, statistical analysis, and more). One of the central points of knowledge when using pandas is dataframes, and the creation, manipulation, and analysis of tabluar data. Pandas is also accessible in that it allows for the importing of data from a variety of file types, and is central in creating many comparable features to working with dataframes in R. https://pandas.pydata.org/about/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy: Numpy is the foundational, open-source Python package for data analysis and scientific computing, as it provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. Numpy allows for the support of large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and comes with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays and allow for researchers to work with these objects. Being the numerical mathematics extension of Python, the functionality of Numpy is far-ranging, and works with these multidimensional arrays to either be created, edited, and/or analyzed. Numpy is often used along with SciPy and Matplotlib, with this combination becoming a more modern and complete programing language when compared to MatLab, the previous platform used in technical computing and for bioanalysis. https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python and Numpy, which is Python's numerical mathematical extension. This means that a wide range of plots and code can be made using this library, including histograms, scatter plots, 3D plots, and image plots, among others. Matplotlib has several toolkits installed that allow for a greater functionality of the library, such as Seaborn, which used for analysis methods like the heatmap and is a high level interface for drawing statistical graphics. Another domain specific tool of matplotlib was DNA Features Viewer, which is a library that helps visualize and interact with DNA features (from GenBank or Biopython SeqRecords) through plots and figures. Matplotlib has available application programming interfaces (APIs) which enbed plots into GUI applications, and due to its wide-range of functions it works as an effective cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library. https://matplotlib.org/\n",

    "Biopython: Biopython is a collection of open-sourced Python code used for computational biology and bioinformatics in a non-commercial setting. Numerous developers have worked on the Biopython package, which has a variety of uses that can read in information ranging from genomes to sequence annotations, with the ability to create, edit, and analyze multiple data formats. One of the focuses of Biopython is to take complex information and manipulating the sequence/object in such a way that it is like manipulating a python string. Biopython can also be used for accessing online databases that contain biological information (ex. NCBI, PubMed, PNAS, etc.), using its numerous capabilites and classes to help in performing analysis. Biopython was primarily developed as a way to remove redundancies in coding for bioinformatics researchers, and also to help in quicker analysis of specific file formats.

    "The clustering plotting method would display patterns and visualize  similarities in the species data  for the great white shark histone genes, and would allow for the creation of a tree structure based upon the data similarities of these genes. The heatmap would be the plotting method used to demonstrate which histone genes are similar to the other compounds being studied in the dataset, where it would show if these histone genes could be positively selected and involved in the maintenance of genomic stability across different species, and especially evident in great white sharks."

    "BLAST results show much of the H2AX great white shark genome relation going back to the Carcharodon carcharias histone H2AX and the H2AX-like genome, while there was some relation seen as well with Scyliorhinus canicula (small spotted catshark chromosomes 27 and 31) and Chiloscyllium plagiosum (Whitespotted bamboo shark). No relation was seen to the human H2AX gene based off this sequence and the E value threshold. The hierarchical clustering and heatmap results would go a long way to show whether or not the hypothesis is correct or not, as their representation of the data analysis of the specified parameters would allow for answers to be given. Clustering would show the tree structures from data similarities it would show how the histones related to one another, and the heatmap would show the different expression levels of the histone genes from different samples to see if similarities existed. The color coding and showing the up/down regulation of the specific histone genes and families that are involved in genomic stability from the heatmap hopefully also highlights the overall amount of upregulated genes related to genomic stability in great white sharks, if not just the histone genes. At this stage it is impossible to say if the hypothesis was correct or incorrect, as there is no definitive answer to show if the effective expansion of genes responsible for genomic stability was caused by the positive selection of histone genes like H2AX in great white sharks and other organisms with similar histone genes."
